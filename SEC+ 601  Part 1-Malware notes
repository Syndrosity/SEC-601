1. Malware 
Propagation Techniques
        - short for malicious software 
        - does evil action(Stealing data, infect systems)
        - 2 components, propagation mechanism & payload
        Any object can carry any payload.
        
        Virus
            - spreads from system to system via user action
            - opening email, links, inserting usbs  
            - viruses need a helping hand
            best way to protect is user ed.
            
        Worms
            - spread under their own power
            - infect system vulnerabilities
            - require vulnerable systems
           Stay updated
           1988 RTM worm infected 10% of the internet.
           2010 Stuxnet uranium enrichment in Iran.
           Damaged uranium enrichment equipment
           
         Trojan Horse
             - pretend to be legit software
             - acts as advertised but brings malicious payload
             - application control = good defense
             - limits versions
             RAT Remote Access Trojan
                 - remotely access systems
          
Payloads
        Online Advertisements
        - normally legit but opportune for malware
        - display ads, for malware author to gain benefit
        - pop ups during browsing
        - legit ads that change to malware ads
        
        Spyware
        - gathers information
        - identity theft, espionage, bank account
        - keystroke loggers, monitoring web browsing

Backdoors and Logic Bombs
        
       Backdoors
           - Provide workaround access
           - mechanism to access if customer locks themselves out
           - may not want access, could fall into wrong hands.
         
         Mechanisms
         - hardcoded accounts
         - default passwords
         - unknown access channels
         example: Wargames 1983
         2015 default passwords in cc systems Credit card
       
       Logic Bomb
       - Deliver a triggered payload
       - Date/Time met
       - file contents modified
       - api call results
       example: 2003 logic bomb south korea, https://www.wired.com/2013/03/logic-bomb-south-korea-attack/
       Friday 13th logic bomb. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_(computer_virus)
 
 - change default passwords
 - disable unused accounts
 - monitor bulletins
       
Advanced Malware 
    
   [ 2 Advanced Concepts ]
    
        Root Account
            - Super user account that provides unrestricted access to system resources
            - reserved for system admins
            - usually done for escalating user privileges.
            - deliver a variety of payloads
                Backdoors
                Botnet agents
                adware/spyware
                antitheft mechanisms
            - ring protection model
             user mode vs kernal mode
     User Mode rootkits = run with normal privileges + easy to write and difficult to detect.
     Kernel Mode rootkits = run with system privileges. difficult to write and easy to detect.
     
     Fileless Viruses
         Remain in computer memory.
         - Microsoft Office macros
         - Javascript Code
         - Windows Registry persistence. (instruct windows to reload after reboot.)
         
Understanding Botnets
        - Reasons: Steal computing power, network bandwidth and storage capacity.
        - Joining infected systems to botnets.
        - Net work of infected machines
      1. Infect system with malware
      2. Gain control.
      3. Join to botnet
      4. Lay dormant
      
      They don't use them, but rather sell for services.
      - Rent out computing power
      - Deliver Spam
      - Engaging in DDoS attacks
      - Mining Bitcoin
      - Waging Brute Force Attacks.
      (Any situation where computing power or network connectivity is a resource)
     
     BotNet Command and Control
     - Command and control network relay orders
     - Communication must be indirect and redundant.
     IRC Internet Relay Chat
     Twitter
     Peer to Peer within the botnet.
     
     Botnet Operator --> Target --> Bot --> Other Systems --> C & C network --> execute instructions accross Internet
     
Malicious Script Execution
 - sequence of instructions written in a progamming language to automate our work.
 - setup to execute scripts in a number of ways,
 - shell scripts: Run at the command line and intergrate with the operating system.
 - application scripts: Run within a software application and integrate with that application
 - Programming Languages: Allow the creation general purpose code to do any task.
     Attackers may write scripts to perform malicious tasks.
     Be familiar with
     Bash: linux and mac systems.
     Powershell: windows systems
     Visual Basic: applications macro language for microsoft office.
     Python: general purpose scripting language.
     
2. Understanding Attackers

     Cybersecurity Threats
         - Internal Vs. External sources
         - Level of Sophistication
         - Access to resources
         - Motivation
         - Intent
         Solo to Governments
      
      Script Kiddies
          - Unskilled attackers who simply reuse hacking tools developed by others.
          - easily defeated with patching, firewalls, endpoint security software and intrustive prevention systems.
      Hacktivists 
          - use hacking tools to advance social and political agendas.
      Criminal syndicates
          - use hacking tools such as ransomware for financial gain.
          - competitors may use hacking tools for corporate espionage.
              ex: cardinals hacked DB of astros MLB 2017
      
      Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
          - difficult to attack
          - target everyone not just govt targets
          - state sponsored to find information or access to critical systems.   
             ex: cyber gangs in china attack google.
             
      White Hat vs Black Hat vs Grey Hat
      
      White: Operate with permission and good intent
      Black: Operate illegally with malicious intent
      Grey: Without permission but with good intent.
      
     Preventing Insider Threats
         most costly and dangerous come from insiders
         - risk of internal compromise.
         - steal info, money, or damage the org.
         
         51% of security breaches are insider attacks
         67% of insider breaches were more costly than outside.
         can occur from trusted users (IT, Execs, etc)
        
        Privilege Escalation Attacks
            - Admin/Executives/Users .
            - one case = user --> admin privileges.
            - someone may or may not have the skills to implement .
            
            
        HR Practices to control Insider threats
        - perform background checks.
        - only give permissions people need.
        - multiple users for sensitive operations.
        - mandatory vacations for critical staff.
        
        
        Shadow IT
           - exposes risk through the use of unapproved technology services.
     
     Attack Vectors
     - attack paths for cybersec 
     
     - Email: phishing messages with malicious content.
     - Social media: influence campaigns to gain unauthorized access.
     - Removable media drives: usb flash, hard drives. malware infections, control through unauthorized access.
     - card skimmers: read magnetic stripes and card cloning attacks. 
     
     Cloud Services:
         - improperly secured content and systems.
         - look for improper access controls security flaws, api keys or passwords.
         
     Direct Access Networks
         - unsecured network jacks
         - physical computer touch points
         - tampering with devices, backdoor access.
         
     Wireless Network:
         - allow attackers to remotely attack an organizations network
     
     Zero days and the Advanced Persistent Threat
         - patches protect against many cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
         - not always possible, vulnerabilities lurk in existing code.
         
        Ethical disclosure
            1. Notify the vendor of the vulnerability.
            2. Provide the vendor a reasonable amount of time to create a patch.
            3. Disclose the vulnerability publicly.
 
 * Researchers could potentially hold onto threats and vulnerabilities they find as a secret weapon*
 
        Zero-Day Vulnerability
        - A vulnerability in a product that has been discovered by at least
          one researcher but has not yet been patched by the vendor.
        - applying patches will not protect against this. no patch or ability to detect
        
        Window of Vulnerability 
        - time between discovery of the Zero day vulnerability and the time it takes to patch it
        - Exploiting zero days is difficult.
        
        Advanced Persistent Threats
        - well funded and highly skilled
        - typically government sponsored 
        - have access to zero days and other sophisticated weapons.
        - work methodically to gain access to the target.
        
        Defending is difficult.
             - stron security measures
             - monitoring
             - encryption

3. Threat Intelligence
    
    Allows teams to stay up to date on current risks
    
    Threat Intelligence: Set of activities that an organization undertakes to educate itself about 
    changes in cybersecurity in the cybersecurity threat landscape, and adapt security controls
    based upon that information.
    
    Open-Source Intelligence
        - Uses public information
        - Security websites
        - vulnerability databases
        - news media
        - social media
        - dark web
        - information sharing centers
        - file repositories
        - code repositories
        - security researchers
        
    Email Address Harvesting
        Searching for valid email addresses.
        develop list of targets for social engineering attack.
        use addreses to send out phishing attacks.
        - many companies offer propprietary and closed-source threat intelligence solutions.
        (info briefs to summarize critical security issues, IP reputation services that provide real time info
        about IP addresses engaged in cyber security threat activities.
      
      
    3 Criteria for evaluating threat intelligence sources.
        1. Timelinessl: How promptly is the threat intelligence delivered?
        2. Accuracy: Is the data correct?
        3. Reliability: Is the provider consistent?
  
  Managing Threat Indicators
      - Properties that describe a threat
      - information only useful if shared among collaborators
      - if we don't all share the same language, it becomes difficult.
      
      Cyber Observable eXpression (CybOX): standardized schema for categorized security observations
      Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX): standardized language to communicate security information 
      between stystems and organizations
      Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII): set of services that share security information 
      between systems in organization.
      
      Community driven effort as part of DHS
      
      Exam only requires STIX and TAXII
      
      OpenIOC 
      Mandiant threat framework.
      
  Intelligence Sharing
      
      Functions Supported by Intelligence
          - Incident Response 
          - Vulnerability Management
          - Risk Management.
          - Security Engineering
          - Detection and monitoring.
      ISAC
          Information Sharing and Analysis Centers
              - Cybersec teams from competing industries to cooperate
              (Automotive, Aviation, Comms, Defense Industrial, etc.)
              - Usually nonprofit organizations
              - seek out and join 
  
  Threat Research
          Process of using threat intelligence to get in the heads of our enemies.
          
          Reputational Threat Research: identify potentially malicious actors based upon their use of IP Address, email address,
          domains, etc. that were previously used in attacks.
          
          Behavioral threat research: Identify potentially malicious actors based upon the similarity of their behaviors
          to past attackers.
          
          Research Sources
              - Vendor websites
              - vulnerability feeds
              - Cybersecurity conferences
              - academic journals
              - RFC documents
              - Local industry groups
              - social media
              - threat feeds
              - Adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP)
   
   Identifying threats
       use a structured approach
       
       3 Ways to use a structured approach
       
       1. Asset Focused: Asset inventory as the basis for analysis
           Ex: Severing a single fiber optic cable.
       2. Threat Focus: Identify how specific threats may affect each information system
           EX: how a hacker might affect their systems (capability based)
       3. Service Focus: Identify the impact of various threats on a specific service.
  
   Automating Threat Intelligence
       
       Automating the blacklisting of IP addresses from threat feeds. Updated in real time
       using threat feeds.
       
       Automated blocking may cause service disruptions.
           First deploy in alert only mode to manually review before blocking potential threats.
       Automated feeds can also be combined for robust filtering.
       
       Incident response is a very manual process.
       
       Data Enrichment: Automatically supplements incident data.
         Sample Data Enrichment Task
            - perform recon on address
            - retrieve related log records
            - trigger a vulnerability scan
       
       SOAR Security, Orchestration, Automation and Response
       
       Machine Learning allows the automated creation of malware signatures.
       
       
    Threat Hunting
        In today's threat landscape we make the assumption of compromise.
            This means that a given we have already been compromised, we should go then searching for those compromised systems
           Threat hunting:  An organized systematic approach to seeking out indicators of compromise on our networks
           using expertise and analytic techniques.
           
           - need to think like our adversary
           - establish a hypothesis
           - intelligence fusion
           
           Indicators of Compromise
               - Unusual binary files
               - Unexprected Process or resource consumption
               - Deviations in network traffic 
               - Unexplained log entries
               - Unapproved configuration changes.
     
4. Social Engineering Attacks
    
      Social Engineering
          - Manipulation people into divulging information or performing an action that undermines security.
          - ex: posing as help desk technician
          - 6 main reasons
          Authority: People defer to authority (look of distinguished ages, appearance) yale experiment/Art of Intrusion
          Intimidation: Scaring people. Brow beating, threatening into compliance.
          Consensus: social proof, the herd mentality
          Scarcity: Getting the last one, (missing an opportunity)
          Urgency: time is running out. feel pressured to act quickly, there to perform critical repair. "can't waste time"
          Familiarity: We say yes to people we like. Flattery, false compliments. 
          
          Education is the solution.
          Wariness is a virture
     
     
     Impersonation Attacks
        Spam: unsolcited commerical email
        Phishing: illiciting personal information/recon phase of a larger attack
        Prepending messages: [SAFE] Tag, impersonating security tags
        Spear Phishing attack: target attack, employees with company jargon/invoice scams
            Whaling: Targeting attacks on executives (try to obtain money, authority, etc of a leader)
        Pharming attacks: Fake websites that look legitimate, user logs into fake site and now lose access
        Vishing: voice phishing to reveal information.
        Smishing and SPIM: SMS and IM spam
        Spoofing: faking an identity
        
      They don't all need to be successful, they just need one victim
      
     Identity fraud and pretexting
        fraud targets individuals
        
        Pretexing: Impersonate a consumer. (Requires security at every set of the process)
            - Gain access to bank account, convince to change numbers.
            - social media can give away security questions.
            - passes the company's test
            - switches the numbers.
    
     Watering Hole Attacks
         - Users trust the websites they visit, to some extent
         - browsers and add-ons often have vulnerabilities
         - users are conditions to click OK on security warnings.
       Limitations
         - attackers cant just built their own sites
         - why would users visit the website
         - content filtering can block known malware sites
       
       Step 1: Compromise a highly targeted website.
       Step 2: Choose a client exploit and bundle in a botnet
       Step 3: Place the malware on the compromised website
       Step 4: Sit back and wait for infected systems to phone home.
       
     Physical social engineering
         - Shoulder surfing: watching someone's screen
             be aware of who's around you / privacy filter
         - dumpster diving: digging through the trash/looking for sensitive information
             Shred documents, can be recycled
         - Tailgating: slipping in behind someone
             Swipe your badge all the time, if you have no badge request one
         
5. Common Attacks        
    
    Password Attacks
        - undermine attacks and information security
        
        /etc/passwd: Password File (Linux system)
        - password hash computed via a 1 way function.
        -  hash = hash = user logged in
        /etc/shadow: shadow file
        
        Hash Function: a mathematical function that converts a variable-length input into a fixed length output.
          1. It must produce a completely different output for each input.
          2. It must be computationally difficult to retrieve the input from the output.
          3. It must be computationally difficult to find two different inputs that generate the same output.
            (Known as a collision)
          
          The birthday problem: Collisions become common with large samples
              What are the odds two people will share a birthday?
              100% with 367
              50% with 23 people
              99.9% with 70 people
              
         Algorithms must be designed to take care of the birthday problem.
         Cracking Passwords are difficult
         
         Brute Force Attacks
             - Try all the possibilities

             - prohibit the use of common passwords to combat this
         
         Credential Stuffing
             - Exploits reused passwords
             - counting on the fact users reuse the same password
             
         Multifactor Authentication
             - stops spraying and credential stuffing
             
      Adversarial Artificial Intelligence
          - Machine Learning: Discover knowledge in data
          - Artifical Intelligence: Simulate human thought
         
        Descriptive Analytics: seek to describe our data
        Predictive Analytics: Predict future events and behavior.
        Prescriptive Analytics: simulations to optimize our behavior. 
        
       Adversarial AI 
           - looks to exploit ML algos and AI
           - Breach confidentiality of machine learning algorithms
           - inject tainted data into training processes
           - fool deployed algorithms
       
       We must build AI models that withstand adversarial attacks.
             
6. Understanding Vulnerability Types
   
  Vulnerability Impact
    
    CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
         
         Confidentiality: Protects information and systems from unauthorized access [keep secrets from prying eyes]
             - Disclosure attacks seek to undermine confidentiality.
             - Data breachers are violations of confidentiality.
             - Data exfiltraion removes sensitive information from an organization's control.
         
         Integrity: Protects information and systems from unauthorized modification
             - Alteration attacks seek to undermine integrity.
         
         Availability: Ensures that information and systems are available for authorized users when needed.    
             - Denial attacks seek to undermine availability. Ex overwhelm systems or cause crashes
         
         Categories of Risk
             - Financial involve monetary loss to the organization.
             - Reputational impacts how stakeholders view our organization.
             - Strategic jeopardizes our ability to meet our major goals and objectives.
             - Operational affects the ability to carry out day-to-day activities.
             - Compliance involves potential violations of laws or regulations.
    
             
  Supply Chain Vulnerabilities
        
        issues may occur in the supply chain.
        End of life announcements; running products that lack support introduce significant security risks.
        
      1. End of Sale 
          - product will no longer be offered for purchase, but the vendor will support existing customers
      2. End of Support
          - the vendor will discontinue support for the existing users of the product.
      3. End of Life
          - Vendor no longer will provide any support or updates for the product
              at this point you will have to upgrade (most likely)
       Keep track of all products used by your organization.
       
      Vendors may fail to provide adequate support for existing products.
      vendors may not disclose the use of embedded systems.
      
      Mitigate risks associated with data storage and other vendor dependencies.
      
    Configuration vulnerabilities
     Can have significant impact on security
         - Default configurations may contain misconfigured firewalls, unnecessary open permissions, guest accounts,
           default passwords, unsecured root accounts, and other issues.
     Follow documented security standards and baselines when configuring systems and applications.
     
     Cryptographic Vulnerabilities
         - Weak cipher suites
         - Weak cryptographic protocol implementations.
         - Poor key management (eavesdropping, false comms, false signatures)
         - Poor certificate management
         
     Patch Management
         Receive all security updates provided by manufacturers to correct known vulnerabilities
             - Operating systems
             - Applications
             - Firmware
     
     Account Management
             - Carefully manage accounts to prevent accidental or intentional misuse.
             
     Least Privilege: limit user privileges ( only have what's needed per user )
     
   Architectural Vulnerabilities
       
       IT Architecture
           Processes and practices used to design systems
           Incorporate security early.
           Avoid bolt on security requirements
           
        Untrained users and weak business processes can be just as dangerous as technical flaws.
        
        System Sprawl
        New devices are connected to a network, but old devices are not promptly disconnected, leading to security
        vulnerabilities.
        More risky when assets are undocumented.
        
7. Vulnerability Scanning

    What is Vulnerability Management?
        Software is complex
        - Linux kernel contains over 24  million lines of code
        - Thousands of lines change every day
        Flaws in code lead to security vulnerabilities
      
        Vulnerability Patching Process
          1. The company learns of a vulnerability.
          2. Developers analyze the issue and develop a patch.
          3. The company releases the patch to customers.
          4. Customers apply the patch to remediate the vulnerability.  
        
        Most organizations have many different components that require frequent security patches.
        
        Vulnerability Management 
            Detects, remediates, and reports vulnerabilities.
            
        Why Manage Vulnerabilities?
            - Maintain system security
            - Comply with corporate policy (fit within higher level programs)
            - Comply with regulatory requirements
            
        PCI DSS Requirement (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
            -required for anyone handling credit card information
            1. Conduct quarterly internal and external vulnerability scans
            2. Repeat scans after any significant change
            3. Use an approved scanning vendor (ASV)
            4. Remediate and rescan until you achieve a clean report
        
        FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act)
            Conduct vulnerability scans regularly.
            Analyze the results of scans
            Remediate legitimate vulnerabilities
            Share information with other agencies. 
            
        Combine 3 different vulnerability tests as you build out your network
        
        Network Vulnerability Scans - Application Scans - Web Application Scans
        
        Vulnerability scanning doesn't happen in a vacuum, vet the results for false positives
        and other errors.
        
    Identify Scan Targets
        You'll need to develop a list of the specific systems and devices you will scan
        
        Asset Inventory
            - provides the starting point for vulnerability scanning.
            - vulnerability scanners can generate system inventories.
        
        Impact: What is the highest data classification handled by the system?
        Likelihood: What is the network exposure?
        Criticality: What impact does the system have on business operations?
        
        You'll need an asset inventory even if you choose to scall all of your systems.

         Agent-Based Scanning
             Installs software on each target device to check for vulnerabilities.
             Some choose not to because that means installing more software on their servers
         
         Credentialed Scanning
             - Use passwords to log into systems.

    Analyzing Scan Reports
            Cybersecurity analysts need to present different information to different audiences
            
            Prioritization Factors
                - Vulnerability Severity
                - System Criticality
                - Information Sensitivity
                - Remediation difficulty
                - System exposure
            
            Vulnerability Validation
                - Confirms accuracy that the vulnerability exists
                    Is the report a false positive?
                    Revoew all the details of a scanner report
                - Does the system run the affeceted OS or application?
                - Is ther vulnerability a documented exception?

8. Penetration Testing and Exercises
        
        Penetration Testing places security professionals in the roles of attackers.
        During a pen test, usually start at gathering information about vulnerable systems.
        The goal is to successfully beat security controls.
        
      Document the rules of engagement before beginning a penetration test.
         - White Box: Attackers have full information before they begin the test.
         - Grey Box: Attackers have limited information before they begin the test
         - Black Box: Attackers have no information about the target before they begin the test.
      
      Pen Test Process
      
      Discovery --> Attack Phase (Gain Access --> Escalate Privileges --> System Browsing --> Install Additional Tools)
           ^                                       |
           |    Additional discovery               |
            ---------------------------------------
      Pivot: After exploiting a vulnerability in a system, attackers use that system as a base from 
      which to target other systems on the same local network.
      
      Persistence: After exploiting a vulnerability in a system attackers install tools on that 
      system to allow future access - even if the initial vulnerability is corrected.
        
      Clean up at the end of the attack.
      
      Pen tests provide valuable insight but they are labor intensive.
      
    Bug Bounty Programs
        Open Security Testing
           - encourage attackers to report vulnerabilities in a responsible fashion.
           - Logs show that attackers will probe on a continuous basis
           - Some are automated looking for vulnerabilities
           - Bug Bounty programs allow you to harness the work of hackers for your own purposes
           - Vendors offer both self-managed and fully-managed bounty programs.
    
    Cybersecurity Exercises
        May have a competitive format
            - Identify vulnerabilities in systems
            - provide participants with hands-on experience attacking and securing systems
             
        Red Team: Attackers who will try to undermine security
        Blue Team: Defenders who will secure the systems from attack
        White Team: Observers and judges who manage the exercise
        
        Purple Team: Combines knowledge from the red and the blue team during a lessons-learned session after the exercise.
